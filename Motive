The core motive behind this project is to make advanced technology accessible to everyone, regardless of their financial background. 
Most AI, ML, and robotics systems in the market are expensive and out of reach for 
many students â€” especially those in schools, hostels, or small towns.

This initiative is born from the belief that learning should never be limited by money. Using low-cost alternatives, recycled materials, 
and open-source tools, this project aims to:

Empower young minds to build intelligent systems on their own

Promote a culture of innovation through affordability

Help students gain real-world skills in AI, ML, and robotics

Prove that with the right guidance and mindset, even a small budget can build big dreams

"India needs creators, not just consumers. Let's build the future, one smart jugaad at a time."
